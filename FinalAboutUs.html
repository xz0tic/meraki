    <p>Our mission at Meraki is to provide artists with the tools, resources and platform</p>
    <p>for their creativity to flow freely. We are committed to building a professional</p>
    <p>space where artwork of all mediums can be displayed by artists everywhere</p>
    <p>and shared with the world. It's clear that technology and social media</p>
    <p>dominate our everyday lives and we saw the need for artists to have</p>
    <p>their own space, free from regular social media users, to display their</p>
    <p>work. Meraki gives artists the space to expand their portfolios,</p>
    <p>and connect with other artists, potential buyers or gallaries.</p>
    <p>Thank you for supporting Meraki and our mission. We hope you enjoy</p>
    <p>using Meraki as much as we did creating it.</p>
